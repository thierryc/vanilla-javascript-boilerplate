# Vanilla Javascript Boilerplate

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

Jumpstart your JavaScript projects with a modern Vanilla JavaScript Boilerplate, providing a pre-configured foundation for building applications with only the core features of the language.

## Get Vanilla Scoop

Vanilla JavaScript is plain, unmodified JavaScript. It is the most basic form of the language and includes only its core features and functions. This contrasts with other types of JavaScript, such as libraries or frameworks, which add additional features and capabilities to the language. Many developers prefer to use vanilla JavaScript for its simplicity and flexibility.

## ECMAScript 6

In Vanilla JavaScript, an ES6 (ECMAScript 6) function is a function that is written using the new syntax and features introduced in the ES6 version of the JavaScript language. This includes things like arrow functions, classes, and template literals, among other features.

Here is an example of a simple ES6 function in Vanilla JavaScript:

```js
const addNumbers = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
}
```

This function uses the const keyword to declare the function, an arrow function syntax (=>) to define the function body, and template literals (enclosed in backticks) to interpolate the values of a and b in the return statement.

ES6 functions offer several benefits over traditional JavaScript functions, including shorter and more concise syntax, easier handling of this, and support for new language features like classes and modules. Many developers prefer to use ES6 functions in their Vanilla JavaScript projects for these reasons.

## ECMAScript 6 (ES6) VS ECMAScript 7 (ES7)

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and ECMAScript 7 (ES7) are versions of the JavaScript language standard. ES6, also known as ES2015, was a major update to the language that introduced many new features and syntax improvements. ES7, also known as ES2016, added a few smaller features to the language, but was not as significant an update as ES6.

Some of the key new features introduced in ES6 include:

- Arrow functions
- Classes
- Template literals
- Enhanced object literals
- Destructuring
- Default function parameters
- Promises

ES7 added a few new features, including:

- Exponentiation operator (**)
- Array.prototype.includes() method
- Async/await syntax

Overall, ES6 was a major update to the JavaScript language that introduced many new and useful features, while ES7 added a few smaller improvements.
