# Vanilla Javascript Boilerplate

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

This is a modern and simple boilerplate for Vanilla JavaScript projects. It is based on the latest version of ECMAScript (ES2020) and provides support for ES6 and ES7 features out of the box.

## Features

- Uses Parcel as the build system, which makes it easy to get started and produces small, efficient bundles
- Includes a set of polyfills to ensure that your code works in older browsers
- Supports CSS modules, which allows you to write modular and reusable CSS code
- Comes with a development server that automatically reloads the page when you make changes to your code
- Includes a linter and formatter to help you write clean, consistent code
